# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report
This completed document shows my ability to complete a vulnerability assessment and code securely.

# Secure Software Development Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains artifacts demonstrating my proficiency in secure software development practices, including vulnerability assessment and secure coding. In this README, I respond to questions reflecting on my experience with a fictional client, Artemis Financial, and the work completed for their software security needs.

## Client Summary and Software Requirements

Artemis Financial was a fictional client for whom I conducted a vulnerability assessment and implemented secure coding practices. They sought assistance in identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities in their financial software application to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with industry regulations.

## Achievements in Finding Software Security Vulnerabilities

I successfully identified and addressed various security vulnerabilities during the vulnerability assessment, including injection flaws, authentication weaknesses, and sensitive data exposure. Coding securely is crucial to preventing cyber threats and maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

## Challenging Aspects and Benefits of the Vulnerability Assessment

While conducting the vulnerability assessment, one challenging aspect was identifying subtle vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. However, the evaluation provided valuable insights into the security posture of the software application, enabling targeted mitigation efforts to strengthen its resilience against potential threats.

## Increasing Layers of Security and Future Mitigation Techniques

I implemented a combination of technical controls, secure coding practices, and security testing methodologies to enhance security. In the future, I plan to use automated vulnerability scanning tools, more manual code reviews, and threat modeling techniques to assess vulnerabilities comprehensively and prioritize mitigation strategies based on risk severity and business impact.

## Ensuring Functional and Secure Code

After refactoring the code, I conducted rigorous testing to verify its functionality and security. This included maven dependency tests and code analysis to ensure the application behaved as expected and was resilient against common security threats. I also performed additional security testing and code review rounds to identify any potential weaknesses introduced during the refactoring process.

## Resources, Tools, and Practices

Throughout the assignment, I utilized industry-standard security frameworks, secure coding guidelines, and vulnerability scanning tools like OWASP Dependency-Check. Additionally, I applied coding practices such as input validation, error handling, and secure cryptographic algorithms to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.

## Demonstrable Skills for Future Employers

The artifacts in this repository, including the vulnerability assessment and secure software reports, prove my ability to identify and mitigate security risks in software applications. I also demonstrate proficiency in implementing secure coding practices, conducting security testing, and effectively communicating security findings.
